    <div class="card-header">Behavior-driven development</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Behavioral development is a method of software development that has evolved from test-based development.
         Behavioral development combines the general techniques and principles of testing-based development. It aims to provide a shared tool 
         for software development to the development team and management team.

    <div class="card-header">Design-driven development</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Design driven development uses design as part of a process to learn and better define requirements in order to build better, more informed technology solutions. It can also be
           looked at as a process whereby design and user experience drives the development of a product or software application. This leads to products that people enjoy using and want to tell others about.</p>

    <div class="card-header">Domain-driven design</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Domain-based design is a software design approach that focuses on modeling software to fit
         a domain according to the input of experts in that domain. In object-oriented programming,
         this means that the structure of the software code and coincide with the business area. </p>

    <div class="card-header">Secure by design</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Secure by design, in software engineering, means that software products and capabilities have been designed to be foundationally secure.
        Alternate security strategies, tactics and patterns are considered at the beginning of a software design, and the best are selected and enforced by the architect
        ure, and they are used as guiding principles for developers. It is also encouraged to use strategic design patterns that have beneficial effects on security, even tho
        ugh those design patterns were not originally devised with security in mind. </p>

  <div class="card text-dark bg-warning mb-3" style="max-width: 40rem;">
    <div class="card-header">Test-driven development</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Test-based development is a method of software development where tests are written before the software itself. The development process consists of short iterations, in which the failed test is written first and then the minimum code to pass the test. This development ensures that all code is always tested.

    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Acceptance-based development is a development methodology based on communication between business customers, developers and testers.
         ATDD encompasses many of the same practices as specification specification, behavioral development, role-based development, and support-based development, also known as story-based development.</p>

    <div class="card-header">Continuous test-driven development</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Continuous test-driven development (CTDD)
       is a software development practice that extends test-driven development (TDD) by means of automatic test execution in the background, sometimes called continuous testing. </p>

  <div class="card text-white bg-dark mb-3" style="max-width: 40rem;">
    <div class="card-header">Specification by example</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Specification by example (SBE) is a collaborative
         approach to defining requirements and business-oriented functional tests for software products based on capturing
          and illustrating requirements using realistic examples instead of abstract statements.</p>

    <div class="card-header">Data-driven development</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">In computer programs, data-based programming is a programming paradigm in which program statements describe the data to be matched and the processing required, rather than defining a sequence of steps to take. </p>
